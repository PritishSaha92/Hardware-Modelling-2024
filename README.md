# Hardware Modelling - General Championship, IIT Kharagpur

This project demonstrates an autonomous waste detection system designed to identify and track floating waste using a YOLO v8 nano model. Trained on the Trans-Annotations in FLoW and Context datasets, the model achieved an accuracy of 82%, enabling accurate waste detection in various aquatic environments.
## 1.Data Augmentation: Enhanced dataset from 3,000 to 7,000 images using Roboflow for improved accuracy.
## 2.Hardware Setup: Implemented with Raspberry Pi, utilizing the GPIO library to control image capture and perform real-time inference.
## 3.Real-Time Inference: Optimized the setup for efficient and autonomous waste detection.
